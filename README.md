# HR-Data-Project

This data analysis and visualization project primarily focused on using Power BI to create a dashboard for HR staff which includes analytics and insights that might prove useful to them.
This project begins with some minor data cleaning and creating columns and measures using DAX for gaining deeper insights into the data.
Next, I created a visually pleasing dashboard which focuses on some primary KPIs, and data regarding the number and percent of attrition in the company based on different variables such as age, gender and salary.
